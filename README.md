# ðŸ§ª Amazon A/B Testing Simulation

This project simulates an A/B test for a hypothetical e-commerce platform like Amazon. It models user behavior across control and test groups, analyzing:

- Page Visit Rate
- Average Time on Page
- Conversion Rate

It includes:

- Data Simulation  
- A/B Statistical Testing (Chi-Square, T-Test)  
- Visualizations  
- Business Insights  

## Objective

Evaluate whether a new product page design (test group) leads to higher engagement and conversions compared to the existing one (control group).

## Tools Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas)
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Scipy.stats (Chi-square, T-test)

## Files

- 'amazon_ab_test.ipynb' â€“ Full A/B testing analysis notebook
- 'README.md' â€“ Project overview and documentation

## Insights

- No significant difference in page visits (p=0.7440)
- No significant difference in time on page (p=0.9811)
- Significant lift in conversions (p=0.0000)
